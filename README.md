# Restaurant Order Analysis
In this repo I've analysed Restaurant Orders Analysis. The data contains cuisine, date and time of each order, the items ordered and details on the type, name and price of the items.

Using SQl functions in MySQLWorkbench lets find out:

- Least and expensive item in Restaurant
- Different Dishes in each category
- Which Order has More Number if items
- Analyze Customer Behavior
- Top 5 orders that spent most money?
- Highest spent order details


## Key Points 
- Insights gathered in this - most of the customers like Italian food even though the price is high
- Most purchased food is hamburger and least is Chicken Tacos(mexican food)
